# code samples
 
This is my first pass at providing examples of my coding to prospective employers. I'm not quite sure yet what exactly is sought here, so I hope what I've provided is useful. If not, feedback is always welcome. :-)

Arguably, my best work was done as either an employee or contractor, however I'm unable to provide any of this until it gets sanitized
(ie, I remove anything that could get me in trouble ethically, or otherwise).

The Samples 1 and 2 provided at this point are from a personal project I've developed over time, and is currently in use in a production environment for a previous employer. Without getting into specifics, the project involves displaying dynamic content within a winforms application, and is written in C#. 

Sample 1 contains 3 class files (ErrorActionItem.cs, ErrorManager.cs, and RunAuditActionItem.cs) that are responsible for writing both audit and error data to a database. 
Further comments can be found in the files themselves.

Sample 2 contains 1 class file (AIDynamicParameterEventHandlers.cs) which contains the event handling code for obtaining user input prior to user-initiated code execution against the database.
Further comments can be found in the file itself.

Thanks,
Mark St Denis
